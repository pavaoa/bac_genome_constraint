0000015	GO:0000015	phosphopyruvate hydratase complex	cellular_component	A multimeric enzyme complex, usually a dimer or an octamer, that catalyzes the conversion of 2-phospho-D-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate and water.
0000049	GO:0000049	tRNA binding	molecular_function	Binding to a transfer RNA.
0000155	GO:0000155	phosphorelay sensor kinase activity	molecular_function	Catalysis of the phosphorylation of a histidine residue in response to detection of an extracellular signal such as a chemical ligand or change in environment, to initiate a change in cell state or activity. The two-component sensor is a histidine kinase that autophosphorylates a histidine residue in its active site. The phosphate is then transferred to an aspartate residue in a downstream response regulator, to trigger a response.
0000156	GO:0000156	phosphorelay response regulator activity	molecular_function	Responds to a phosphorelay sensor to initiate a change in cell state or activity. The activity of the response regulator is regulated by transfer of a phosphate from a histidine residue in the sensor, to an aspartate residue in the response regulator. Many but not all response regulators act as transcriptional regulators to elicit a response.
0000160	GO:0000160	phosphorelay signal transduction system	biological_process	A conserved series of molecular signals found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes; involves autophosphorylation of a histidine kinase and the transfer of the phosphate group to an aspartate that then acts as a phospho-donor to response regulator proteins.
0000166	GO:0000166	nucleotide binding	molecular_function	Binding to a nucleotide, any compound consisting of a nucleoside that is esterified with (ortho)phosphate or an oligophosphate at any hydroxyl group on the ribose or deoxyribose.
0000179	GO:0000179	rRNA (adenine-N6,N6-)-dimethyltransferase activity	molecular_function	Catalysis of the dimethylation of two adjacent adenine residues in a rRNA, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a methyl donor.
0000271	GO:0000271	polysaccharide biosynthetic process	biological_process	The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of a polysaccharide, a polymer of many (typically more than 10) monosaccharide residues linked glycosidically.
0000287	GO:0000287	magnesium ion binding	molecular_function	Binding to a magnesium (Mg) ion.
0000311	GO:0000311	plastid large ribosomal subunit	cellular_component	The larger of the two subunits of a plastid ribosome. Two sites on the ribosomal large subunit are involved in translation: the aminoacyl site (A site) and peptidyl site (P site).
